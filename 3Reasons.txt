1. Technology Choice:
Reason 1: Database Enhancement:

With ordering requests and editing order information, database flexibility is important. Use a database that can scale easily to accommodate spikes in demand during shopping season (e.g. Azure SQL Database).
Reason 2: Microservices Architecture:

Applying microservices architecture helps optimize construction and maintenance costs. Independent microservices can be developed and deployed independently, reducing risk and improving scalability.
Reason 3: Use Azure App Service:

Use Azure App Service for ordering website development. It provides a flexible development environment, pre-integrated with many other Azure services, and supports rapid deployment.
